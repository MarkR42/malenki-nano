CLOCK SHENANIGANS
-----------------

We need a higher clock speed because the default is too slow

The time taken to process a packet, must be significantly less than
the time between packets; otherwise we miss the next one.

Pin and peripheral hardware assignments / usage
Peripherals of the attiny1617 MCU

PA0 - RESET / UPDI - default - not used by code. Used for programming
	firmware
PA1 - UART0 TxD - used for diagnostic serial output.
    Also connected to a red LED (active high) for general usage.
    Maybe we keep this led on most of the time,
    as the serial will be mostly high.

PA2 - GIO1 gpio pin from A7105 radio

PA3 - Motor1F (Weapon) - WO3
PA4 - Motor3R (Right) - WO4
PA5 - Motor3F (Right) - WO5

PA6 - SPI_SDIO - connected to the A7105 radio
PA7 - SPI_SCK - connected to the A7105

PB0 - Motor1R (Weapon) - WO0
PB1 - Motor2R (Left) - WO1
PB2 - Motor2F (Left) - WO2

PB3 - SPI_SCS - chip select - connected to A7105

PB5 - VSENSE - analogue input on the tiny817
    

PC0 - WEAPON3 (optional) - this is an output, it should send pulses
    1000-2000us
    Hardware PWM is generated using TCD outputs WOC and WOD
PC1 - WEAPON2    
    
PC2 - VSENSE - analogue input, potential divider on battery,
        approx 10/43 of bat. voltage.
PC5 - BLINKY - blue LED which indicates signal and flashes in bind mode.

Peripheral usage

USART0 - transmitter - for debug messages
	receiver - unused

TCA0 - timer generates 6x PWM pulses on motors
	use in "split mode"

I think the CMP mappings are probably:
LCMP0 - WO0 - Motor1R
LCMP1 - WO1 - Motor2R
LCMP2 - WO2 - Motor2F
HCMP0 - WO3 - Motor1F
HCMP1 - WO4 - Motor3R
HCMP2 - WO5 - Motor3F

TCB0 - Radio timeout. Controlled by radio.c

TCD0 - use to generate PWM for WEAPON2 / WEAPON3.
    - Also use for a timer interrupt for incrementing the global timer tickcount variable.

Note that the SPI peripheral is not used for spi communication;
    it's not necessary for our usage. SPI can be bit-banged efficiently.

In principle it is possible with this hardware setup, to use gio1 to 
receive data from the a7105 in direct mode using the USART0 peripheral. 
This is complicated and probably not required.

A7105 pin connections:

GIO1 - connected to mcu PA2 pin
GIO2 - (NO LONGER) connected to a blue LED,
    active high. (Connected to a LED of earlier versions of hardware)

SPI pins also connected to respective lines as above.

Note that the a7105 breakout module we use does not break out the 
voltage sense of the a7105 to be used; it is a shame because we could
use it to detect the battery voltage.

HOW TO RUN RADIO:

1. Init routine runs, with no interrupts happening (yet).

2. When init is finished, we will run the radio 100% from interrupts,
    we never do any SPI commands except inside irq.

- TCB0 - we set this up to generate periodic interrupts at the timeout
    period.
- Interrupt for rx packet - A7105 GIO1 pin will go LOW when there is a new
    packet. (GIO1 is high when the rx is waiting / pending, low otherwise)
    We want to interrupt on the falling edge.
    
    When GIO1 goes low, we won't always get a valid packet,
    if the packet is:
    * From a different transmitter
    * Junk
    * Invalid in some way
    * Not the correct type
    
    Then we won't do any hopping, we just restart the rx on the current
    channel, and hope for the best.
    
    We will always need to send the rx strobe command.
    
    If the packet is good, then we will reset the timer,
    and hop to the next channel, then restart the rx.
    We should also copy the good packet into the buffer.
    
- RX Timeout:
    Rx timeout will happen at various times:
    * No transmitter
    * At startup
    * If a packet is lost
    
    We will need to hop to the next channel and restart the rx.
    If sync is lost, we need to go to the first channel.
    
    If in bind mode, then we need to use the bind channel

Serial number and device id:

Example from attiny3217:

device id=1e 95 22
serial number: 51 51 37 41 43 20 34 c0 20 24 
serial number (ascii) is:QQ7AC 4� $

Serial number is not always printable ascii, but it sometimes is.
Serial number is 10 bytes.

Example from attiny1614:
device id=1e 94 22
serial number: 51 4e 4a 4e 4c 20 4b 79 26 41
serial number (ascii) is:QNJNL Ky&A

Attiny1616 - differences from above:

BLINKY is on PB4
VSENSE is on PB5 
PC2, PC3 are NC
PC4 and PC5 don't exist
